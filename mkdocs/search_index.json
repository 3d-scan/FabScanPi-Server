It will be flashed automatically with the current\nfirmware version after the server is started.\n\n\nInstallation with FabScanPi Image (recommended)\n\n\nThe fastest way to start working with FabScan PI is to use the FabScan PI Raspbian Image. \nDowload the image and install it to a SD-Card. After the image is flashed and the Raspberry\nPi is up and runnig follow the instructions in the \nUsage section\n\n\nLatest image release: \n\n\nhttps://github.com/mariolukas/FabScanPi-Build-Raspbian/releases/latest\n\n\nThe image can be build with the FabScanPi Image build script. You will find more \ninformation \nhere\n\n\nInstalling with fresh Raspbian and packages\n\n\nThis description assumes that you have a SD card with a fresh Raspbian image on it. \n\n\nFirst add the fabscan repository to your source list. \n\n\necho \ndeb http://archive.fabscan.org/ jessie main\n \n /etc/apt/sources.list\n\n\n\n\nThen add the FabScan PI repository key to your key chain.\n\n\nwget http://archive.fabscan.org/fabscan.public.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the package list.\n\n\napt-get update\n\n\n\n\nFinish the installation with the needed packages.\n\n\napt-get install fabscanpi-server python-opencv-tbb libtbb2  python-pil python-serial python-pykka python-picamera avrdude\n\n\n\n\nThe FabScan PI server can be started with \n\n\nsudo /etc/init.d/fabscanpi-server start\n\n\n\n\nRead \nUsage\n section for the next steps.\n\n\nInstallation: With Source Code\n\n\nDependencies\n\n\nFabScan PI software depends on some python libraries. You need to install pyserial, pykka, opencv with tbb support \nand picamera. The easiest way to install all dependencies is to use debians package manager apt. Some of the packages, \nlike opencv with tbb support and libtbb are not provided by the official raspbian mirrors. You need to add the\nfabscan repository to your apt source list. \n\n\nBuild Debian package\nInstall dependencies\n\n\nsudo apt-get install build-essential dpkg-dev debhelper devscripts fakeroot cdbs python-setuptools python-support\n\n\n\n\nThe package is build by calling\n\n\nmake deb\n\n\n\n\nAfterwards the package can be installed by \n\n\ndpkg -i fabscabpi-server\npackage-version\n.deb\n\n\n\n\nUpdates\n\n\nUpdates can be installed with debian's apt-get package manager. Log in via ssh and check/install \nupdates with the following command.\n\n\nsudo apt-get update \n apt-get upgrade\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nA configuration file can be found in /etc/fabscanpi/default.config.json. The content of this file \nis in JSON format and can be edited with an editor of your choice (e.g. nano). Be careful and don't\nmiss brackets. JSON is really sensitive in it's format.\n\n\nFolders\n\n\nIn this section you can change the scan output folder and the folder where the ui is located. If \nyou don't know what you are doing, it is a good decision to keep this section untouched.\n\n\n   \nfolders\n : {\n    \nwww\n: \n/home/pi/fabscan/src/www/\n,\n    \nscans\n: \n/usr/local/fabscanpi/scans/\n\n   }\n\n\n\n\nSerial\n\n\nIn this section you can set your port. By default this value is not set, because the\nFabScanPi Server software autodetcts the correct port. Some Arduino and compatible boards differ \nin the port name. The port can be set if you are not using an Arduino UNO or compatible Board. \nIn case that your Arduino is not detected and you can see an error in the /var/log/fabscanpi/fabscan.log\nyou should add the \"port\" attribute to your config.\n\n\nThe autoflash option is True by default, that means that the firmware is flashed automatically to \nthe Arduino or FabScanPi HAT. If you want to use a custom board e.g. sanguinololu, you can set this\nto False and flash the Firmware manually to your board. \n\n\n   \nserial\n : {\n     \nbaudrate\n : 115200,\n     \nport\n: \n/dev/ttyACM0\n,\n     \nautoflash\n: \nTrue\n\n   }\n\n\n\n\nCamera\n\n\nIn this section some camera values are set. The type can be set to PICAM which is default value. There is \nalso an experimental mode for a C270 webcam. But this mode is not further developed. I used it in early \nversions of fabscanpi. \n\n\nThe device is not used for the PICAM. Only if a webcam is used, you have to set the device to the count number\nof your webcam if you have one or more cameras connected to your pi.\n\n\nPreview Resolution is the resolution value for the settings window. \nResolution is the resolution for the picamera python module. You can have a look to the documentation of \npicamera. If you set this to other values please be sure what you are doing, not all resolutions are supported\nby the picam. Some might lead to slower image capturing. \n\n\nThe position values are used to define where the camera is located in the case. All values are in cm. \nThre is an image later in this documentation which explains all the dimension related meassures. \n\n\nFrame dimension is what your camera sees in the case. An easy way to validate this value is to put a \nruler to the backwall of the fabscan ( i used a paper one from IKEA ). Then activate the settings mode\nand read the last value you can read in the image. The default is 23.5 cm. The default value fits most\nof the FabScan setups. This value is used for tansforming image coordinates to world coordinates. \n\n\n\n\n   \ncamera\n : {\n     \ntype\n : \nPICAM\n,\n     \ndevice\n : 1,\n     \npreview_resolution\n:{\n        \nwidth\n: 320,\n        \nheight\n: 240\n     },\n     \nresolution\n:{\n          \nwidth\n: 1296,\n          \nheight\n:972\n      },\n      \nposition\n:{\n          \nx\n: 0.0,\n          \ny\n: 5.5,\n          \nz\n: 27.6\n      },\n      \nframe\n:{\n          \ndimension\n: 23.5\n      }\n   }\n\n\n\n\nLaser\n\n\nThis section describes the laser position and laser stepper motor values. I mentioned position values in the section \nbefore (Camera), have a look at the image. \n\n\nThe angle is set to the angle which was used in the last scan. The rotation_steps value should be used for a laser \nangle change (not implemented yet).Steps defines how many steps the motor can do. In the default case the motor is \nset to 1/16 step mode. A motor with 200 steps per turn can then perform 3200 steps. \n\n\n   \nlaser\n: {\n      \nposition\n:{\n        \nx\n: 10.0,\n        \ny\n: 7.3,\n        \nz\n: 24.5\n      },\n      \nangle\n: 33.0,\n      \nrotation_steps\n: 5,\n      \nsteps\n: 3200\n   }\n\n\n\n\nTurntable\n\n\nIn this section some turntable related values are set. For positioning have a look to the image. \nSteps defines how many steps can be perfomed for a full rotation. This value depends on your motor and driver.\nIn the default case the motor is set to 1/16 step mode. A motor with 200 steps per turn can then perform 3200 steps.\n\n\n   \nturntable\n:{\n     \nposition\n: {\n       \nx\n: 0.0,\n       \ny\n: 0.0,\n       \nz\n: 7.5\n     },\n     \nsteps\n:3200\n   },\n\n\n\n\nScanner\n\n\nThis section defines global scanner related values. Origin is defined as the green horizontal line in the settings\npreview window. It is a also here a good idea to keep that value untouched. Process number defines how many processes\nshould be used for calculating the scan data. Due the Raspberry Pi2 serves 4 cores it is a good idea to keep this\nvalue. Increasing the proccess number does not mean inrceasing speed in all cases. \nMeshlab is not supported in the curren verision of fabscan pi. So you can leave this value. \n\n\n   \nscanner\n: {\n      \norigin\n:{\n        \ny\n : 0.75\n      }\n   },\n   \nprocess_number\n: 4,\n   \nmeshlab\n:{\n     \npath\n: \n/usr/bin/\n\n   }\n}\n\n\n\n\nFor a first try the default values should be fine. But the values in your setup may be different. To be sure measure your\nsetup and modify the values in your default.conf.json file if needed. \n\n\nY values\n\n\n\nX and Z values\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nCan not connect to Arduino.\nIs the Arduino connected to the USB port. Check the port in your fabscanpi-server configuration\nfile. Try another port e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0. \nMore information about changing the configuration can be found in \"FabScan Pi Configuration\"\nsection.\n\n\nCamera is not connected. \nCheck the cable from the Raspberry Pi to the camera module. Be careful the cable can be very\nfragil. Try another camera application for checking camera functionality e.g. \nraspistill\n.\n\n\nSetting up a WIFI connection\n\n\nThis description explains howto setup a wifi stick for raspbian. I prefer to use an EDIMAX dongle, it worked best for me. \nFirst plug in your wifi dongle and log in via ssh with password \"raspberry\" (without quotes):\n\n\nssh pi@\nyour-fabscanpi-ip\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst you have to activate the wifi option in your networking setup. \n\n\nsudo nano /etc/network/interfaces\n\n\n\n\nUncomment the folling lines and save the changes. \n\n\nauto wlan0\nallow-hotplug wlan0\niface wlan0 inet dhcp\nwpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf\niface default inet dhcp\n\n\n\n\nNow restart your network adapters. \n\n\nsudo nano /etc/init.d/networking\n\n\n\n\nIf you type \nsudo ifconfig\n there should be a wlan0 connection in the list. \n\n\nYour fasbcanpi image is ready to go. The only things you have to do is open wpa_supplicant.conf and \ninsert your wifi ssid and your wifi secret.\n\n\nsudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf\n\n\n\n\nSave the file and try to connect to your wifi by typing the following command.\n\n\nsudo ifup wlan0\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases you have to reboot the Raspberry Pi. Check if the wifi dongle's led is bliking.\nIf you want to change your Raspberry Pi to a fix wifi IP address you have to change the interfaces file\nto get a static wifi connection.\n\n\nsudo nano /etc/network/interfaces\n\n\n\n\nChange the files content from \n\n\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nallow-hotplug eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nauto wlan0\nallow-hotplug wlan0\niface wlan0 inet dhcp\nwpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf\niface default inet dhcp\n\n\n\n\nto \n\n\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nallow-hotplug eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nauto wlan0\nallow-hotplug wlan0\niface wlan0 inet static\naddress \nip in your network\n\nnetmask \nyour netmask\n\ngateway \nyour gateway\n\nwpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf\niface default inet dhcp\n\n\n\n\nAfter you changed the file you can restart your network daemon.\n\n\nsudo /etc/init.d/networking restart\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nFabScan Pi is tested on: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogo\n\n\nOS\n\n\nVersions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSX, Windows\n\n\n47.0.2526.106 (64-bit)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOSX, Windows\n\n\n43.0.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default the FabScan PI server binds to all interfaces on port 8080. Pointing your browser to \n\nhttp://ip-of-your-raspbrry-pi:8080\n will open the user interface. If your computer supports bonjour\nyou can point yout browser to \nhttp://fabscanpi.local:8080\n, you can omit the port if you used the SD-Card\nimage.\n\n\nMost Apple devices support bonjour by default. On Windows you can install [Bonjour Print Services for Windows 2.0.2|\n(http://support.apple.com/kb/DL999). You will find more detailed information about this topic for the most common \noperating systems \nhere\n.\n\n\nThe main view provides a camera symbol. By clicking this symbol the live settings dialog appears. On the left side\nis a laser detection preview. Best scan results can be reached, when the red laser line is covered by a blue line.\n\n\n\n\nThe coverage of the lines can be improved by using the different slider settings. A good point to start is the \nthreshold slider. If the environment light is bright, try to set a lower value. If the environment light is low, \nyou should better use a higher slider value. After chnangig the slider have a look at the preview image. The video\nstream leaks for a few milliseconds, sometimes up to a second (depends on the environment lighting). More advanced\nsettings are the camera brightness and contrast settings and if you are using an LED ring/strip of course the \nRGB light setting, which can be used to increase the objects contrast level. A scan can be performed by clicking\nthe scan button in the first settings tab where the threshold and resolution slider are located.\n\n\n\n\nThe resolution slider can be used to set the scan resolution. Sometimes it is better to start with a low resolution\nto control the selected settings result. If the result is nice you can perform a higher resolution scan with the \nsame settings. The current settings are persistent as long as the pi is up and running. The settings are also saved\nwith the scan data after a successful scan. They can be loaded to scan another object with the same settings. E.g. an \nobject what consists of the same material, color etc. \n\n\n\n\nThe sharing dialog can be used to handle the current loaded scan. The sharing dialog provides options to download or \ndelete a scan, and as already mentioned to load the scan settings. \n\n\nPreviously scanned objects can be loaded by calling the load gallery dialog. A gallery of scans appears. By clicking\none of the previously scanned objects loads the scan.",

A motor with 200 steps per turn can then perform 3200 steps.       laser : {\n       position :{\n         x : 10.0,\n         y : 7.3,\n         z : 24.5\n      },\n       angle : 33.0,\n       rotation_steps : 5,\n       steps : 3200\n   }  Turntable  In this section some turntable related values are set. For positioning have a look to the image. \nSteps defines how many steps can be perfomed for a full rotation. This value depends on your motor and driver.\nIn the default case the motor is set to 1/16 step mode. A motor with 200 steps per turn can then perform 3200 steps.      turntable :{\n      position : {\n        x : 0.0,\n        y : 0.0,\n        z : 7.5\n     },\n      steps :3200\n   },  Scanner  This section defines global scanner related values. Origin is defined as the green horizontal line in the settings\npreview window. It is a also here a good idea to keep that value untouched. Process number defines how many processes\nshould be used for calculating the scan data. Due the Raspberry Pi2 serves 4 cores it is a good idea to keep this\nvalue. Increasing the proccess number does not mean inrceasing speed in all cases. \nMeshlab is not supported in the curren verision of fabscan pi. So you can leave this value.       scanner : {\n       origin :{\n         y  : 0.75\n      }\n   },\n    process_number : 4,\n    meshlab :{\n      path :  /usr/bin/ \n   }\n}  For a first try the default values should be fine. But the values in your setup may be different. To be sure measure your\nsetup and modify the values in your default.conf.json file if needed.   Y values  X and Z values",

Pointing your browser to  http://ip-of-your-raspbrry-pi:8080  will open the user interface. If your computer supports bonjour\nyou can point yout browser to  http://fabscanpi.local:8080 , you can omit the port if you used the SD-Card\nimage.  Most Apple devices support bonjour by default. On Windows you can install [Bonjour Print Services for Windows 2.0.2|\n(http://support.apple.com/kb/DL999). You will find more detailed information about this topic for the most common \noperating systems  here .  The main view provides a camera symbol. By clicking this symbol the live settings dialog appears. On the left side\nis a laser detection preview. Best scan results can be reached, when the red laser line is covered by a blue line.   The coverage of the lines can be improved by using the different slider settings. A good point to start is the \nthreshold slider. If the environment light is bright, try to set a lower value. If the environment light is low, \nyou should better use a higher slider value. After chnangig the slider have a look at the preview image. The video\nstream leaks for a few milliseconds, sometimes up to a second (depends on the environment lighting). More advanced\nsettings are the camera brightness and contrast settings and if you are using an LED ring/strip of course the \nRGB light setting, which can be used to increase the objects contrast level. A scan can be performed by clicking\nthe scan button in the first settings tab where the threshold and resolution slider are located.   The resolution slider can be used to set the scan resolution. Sometimes it is better to start with a low resolution\nto control the selected settings result. If the result is nice you can perform a higher resolution scan with the \nsame settings. The current settings are persistent as long as the pi is up and running. The settings are also saved\nwith the scan data after a successful scan. They can be loaded to scan another object with the same settings. E.g. an \nobject what consists of the same material, color etc.    The sharing dialog can be used to handle the current loaded scan. The sharing dialog provides options to download or \ndelete a scan, and as already mentioned to load the scan settings.   Previously scanned objects can be loaded by calling the load gallery dialog. A gallery of scans appears. By clicking\none of the previously scanned objects loads the scan.",
